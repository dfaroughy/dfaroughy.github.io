abstract
===
We propose an extension of the existing experimental strategy for measuring branching fractions of top quark decays, targeting specifically tâ†’jW where *j* is a light quark jet. The improved strategy uses orthogonal b- and q-taggers, and adds a new observable, the number of light-quark-tagged jets, to the already commonly used observable, the fraction of b-tagged jets in an event. Careful inclusion of the additional complementary observable significantly increases the expected statistical power of the analysis, with the possibility of excluding |Vtb|=1 at 95% C.L. at the HL-LHC, and accessing directly the standard model value of the CKM angles.
