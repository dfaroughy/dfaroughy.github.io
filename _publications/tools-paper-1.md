===
HighPT is a Mathematica package for the analysis of high-energy data of semileptonic
transitions at hadron colliders. It allows to compute high-pT tail observables for semileptonic processes, i.e. Drell-Yan cross sections, for dilepton and monolepton final states at
the LHC. These observables can be calculated at tree level within the Standard Model
Effective Field Theory, including the relevant operators up to dimension eight to ensure a
consistent description of the cross section including terms of O(Λ^−4) in the cutoff scale Λ.
For New Physics models with new mediators that can be resolved at LHC energies, HighPT
can also account for the full propagation effects of these new bosonic states at tree level.
Using the available data from the high-pT tails in the relevant LHC run-II searches by the
ATLAS and CMS collaborations, HighPT can also construct the corresponding likelihoods
for all possible flavors of the leptonic final states. As an illustration, we derive and
compare constraints on Wilson coefficients at different orders in the Effective Field Theory
expansion, and we investigate lepton flavor violation for the S3 leptoquark model. The
HighPT code is publicly available at Github
